Project intro:
New City subway system is updating their seasonal pattern to determine the current mass transmit system. 
How did the traffic pattern change compared to pre-Covid. 
Five questions are asked ?

How did the Average weekday traffic pattern change?


How did the average weekend traffic change?


Turnstile utilizations. The busiest and the slowest turnstiles. 

What are the most drastic changes in terms of station traffic?
We first combine all turnstiles counts that belong to the same station. Weekday traffic are combined into one weekday values, and weekend values are combined together. 

Then on a per station basis, the top 20 with the largest percentage change are listed, together with the top 20 with the largest traffic changes.


Jumping the turnstiles, total in traffic versus total out traffic, whole system,

total in total out in a station.

  
One of the questions they have is that if they should expanding their 
subway system, and where to expand.
One of the way to get data is to examine if there is a lot of existing transfer   


Data:
It use 1 week of data in June across 10 years period. The first 8 years are used establish 
the normal pattern, then the last two are used to indicate the covid period. 

Instead of a previous year, a 3 month-ago data is used. Seasonal patterns are present as well as long term trend like populatoin change. 

A 3 week period could be used as well for more , but  

different time period, different number of lines,
