# metis_proj1_EDA
first project in metis course EDA 
Using Python pandas and SQLite to process New York city MTA turnstiles data.

The python note book used to generate the results is mta.ipynb. An empty SQL database file mta.db is needed to run the note book file completely.
    
This python code will generate and save the csv files needed so they are not included
in the repo. The database needs to import the generated mta.csv into the database.
Since the database file is 5 MB, it is not included as part of the repo. 

The proj1_present.pdf is the pdf file for the presentation. The figures in the presentations
are generated by the mta.ipynb and saved to working directory. They are not included in this
repo either.

The initial project plan is the project_plan.txt. The final project summary is Project_summary.txt
